    <h1 style="background-color: black;color:white;text-align: center;">HTML</h1>
    <h2  style="background-color: black;color:white;text-align: center;">DEFINATION</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;color: black;">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
        HTML consists of a series of elements.
        HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
        HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", 
        "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>
        <h3 style="background-color: black;color:white;text-align: center;">USAGE OF HTML</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify;color:black;" >HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and design documents on the web. It structures content by using a series of elements and tags that define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia components. HTML forms the backbone of web pages, allowing browsers to interpret and display content in a visually organized manner. By combining HTML with CSS and JavaScript, developers can create dynamic and visually appealing websites.</p>
        <h4 style="background-color: black;color:white;text-align: center;">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TAG AND ELEMENT</h4>
        <p style="text-align:justify;color: black;">A tag is the basic syntax used in HTML to define elements, typically consisting of an opening tag (e.g., <p>) and a closing tag (e.g., </p>). An element encompasses the opening tag, closing tag, and any content in between, forming a complete structure (e.g., <p>This is a paragraph.</p>). In essence, tags are the building blocks, while elements represent the complete units of content and structure.</p> 
        <h5 style="background-color: black;color:white;text-align: center;">ATTRIBUTES AND ENTITIES</h5>
        <p style="text-align:justify;color: black;">Attributes in HTML provide additional information about elements, typically specified within the opening tag. For example, an image tag might include attributes like src (source) and alt (alternative te  xt) to define the image's location and description. Entities, on the other hand, are special characters that are represented by a specific code, such as &amp; for an ampersand (&) or &lt; for a less-than sign (<). They allow for the inclusion of characters that might otherwise be misinterpreted by the browser as markup. Together, attributes and entities enhance the functionality and clarity of HTML documents.</p>
        <h6 style="background-color: black;color:white;text-align: center;">TYPES OF ATTRIBUTES</h6>
        <p style="text-align:justify;color: black;">HTML attributes can be categorized into several types. Global attributes are applicable to any HTML element and include attributes like class, id, and style, which help with styling and scripting. Event attributes are used to handle user interactions, such as onclick for mouse clicks. Data attributes (e.g., data-*) allow for the storage of custom data on elements, useful for JavaScript manipulation. Finally, specific attributes pertain to certain elements, like src for images or href for links. Each type serves distinct purposes, enhancing the interactivity and functionality of web pages.</p>
